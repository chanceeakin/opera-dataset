## Overview

This is a pack chart of arias, whose size is determined by the frequency with which the aria occurred.

### Cursory Findings

- Normalization continues to rear its ugly head. It's most evidenced with "Ach, ich fühls". To comma, or not to comma? Also, that aria is the most prevalent among the 2019 lists.
- Korngold's "Mein Sehnen, mein Wähnen": 17 Filene entries. Count's Aria: 21 Filene entries. This is me not reading into that -> 😐.
- Playing with color in visualizations is fun!
