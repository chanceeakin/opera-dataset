Using a data set sourced from a certain opera company that performs in a
Barn, this site is an exploration of statistical and historical trends in
audition selection choices.

This site constitutes some preliminary work with visualization of the 2019
audition tour data, as well as some lazy manipulation of the initial data
set. Instances of the dataset exist in both CSV and json, and some helper
utilities are included to convert said dataset into a `pandas.Dataframe`.

There were 3750 instances from 1108 unique arias (operatic solos for
software folks) on audition sheets this year (or they heard 3750 singers
in person...optimistic but unlikely).
