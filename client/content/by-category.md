## Overview

This chart breaks down overall aria instances based on voice type and artist category.

#### Voice types are roughly:

- Soprano (highest female voice)
- Mezzo (lower female voice)
- Counter Tenor (Male Falsettist)
- Tenor (figh male voice)
- Baritone (middle male voice)
- Bass (low male voice)

#### Artist Categories:

- Filene: young professional singers
- Studio: advanced undergraduates and graduate students

### Findings

- While it should come as no surprise, the soprano voice type far and away holds the most offerings.
- The Filene Artists (the more senior/experienced applicants) hold a higher percentage of aria offerings than their Studio counterparts.
- Tenors outnumber baritones. As a former professional baritone, this strikes me as hilarious.
