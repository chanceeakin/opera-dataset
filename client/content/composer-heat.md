## Overview

This chart shows how many times a given composers' aria appeared on the list.

### Cursory Findings

- Mozart is the top offering, which should surprise no one.
- Massenet is not usually considered part of the "core rep", and their heavy inclusion is possibly indicative of a Massenet opera being performed in the upcoming season.
- There's a lot of white space and name normalization that needs to be done to clean up the data set.
